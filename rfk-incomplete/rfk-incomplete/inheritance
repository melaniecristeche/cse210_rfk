What is inheritance and why is it important?

Inheritance is a procedure in which genetic information is given from 
parent to child. Inheritance defines in some way, how genetic material is 
given on from parent to child.
For example, this part of the code (the main) it is using the attributes 
from the method "Cast()" and "Actor()" classes to create the banner, and on 
the other hand, the robot. And this is just an example, in fact, all the game
 is constructed on the base of this concept...

Why is it important? Well, it provides code reusability. You donÂ´t have to 
necessarily write the same code or functions again and again, you can just 
simply inherit the properties of one class into the other.
