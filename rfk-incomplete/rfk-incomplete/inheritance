What is inheritance and why is it important?

Inheritance is a procedure in which genetic information is given from 
parent to child. Inheritance defines in some way, how genetic material is 
given on from parent to child.

For example, this part of the class (artifact.py) it is using the attributes from the 
method "Actor()" to inherit their components from the robot to the artifacts surrounded, to then display a message when it touches an object. And this is just an example, in fact, all the game is constructed on the base of this concept...

Why is it important?

Well, it provides code reusability. You don´t have to 
necessarily write the same code or functions again and again, you can just 
simply inherit the properties of one class into the other.
